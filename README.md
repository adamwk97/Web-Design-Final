# Reflections 

This project was overall quite difficult for me. Combining all of the different elements that were taught over the course was a little hard since it was a Summer course and there was not much time to digest the information. I did take inspiration from the example given and this made it easier for me as I then had an idea of what the website should look like because I had no direction prior. Overall I had spent quite a long time on this project but I am happy with how it turned out and think I applied all of the knowledge I had gained from this course.
